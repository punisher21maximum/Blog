$ python3.6 -m pip --version
ERROR :
in file socket.py

SOLUTION :
I had created a socket.py file. Which is a name of module in python. 
So when python try to import socket.py , it imports your created socket.py 
and gets an error.

So find socket.py file on your laptop
rename or delete it.

$ python3.6 -m pip --version
NO ERROR
